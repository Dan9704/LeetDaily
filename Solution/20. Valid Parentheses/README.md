# LeetDaily Challenge: Valid Parentheses

**LeetCode Problem #20**  
**Difficulty**: Easy

---

### Scenario:
The **Valid Parentheses Problem** requires us to determine if a string containing only the characters `(`, `)`, `{`, `}`, `[`, and `]` is valid. A valid string must satisfy:
1. Each opening bracket must have a corresponding closing bracket.
2. Brackets must close in the correct order (i.e., open brackets must be closed by the most recent matching bracket).

---

### Approach:

1. **Mapping Matching Brackets**:
   - Use a hash map to store the matching opening bracket for each closing bracket.

2. **Using a Stack for Validation**:
   - Traverse each character in the string:
     - If it's an opening bracket, push it onto the stack.
     - If itâ€™s a closing bracket:
       - Check if the stack is empty or if the top of the stack does not match the corresponding opening bracket (using the hash map). If either is true, return `false`.
       - Otherwise, pop the stack to remove the matched opening bracket.
   - At the end, the stack should be empty if all brackets were matched correctly.

### Code (C++):

```cpp
#include <stack>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <string>

class Solution {
public:
    bool isValid(std::string s) {
        std::stack<char> stack;
        std::unordered_map<char, char> map = {
            {')', '('},
            {'}', '{'},
            {']', '['}
        };

        for (char c : s) {
            if (map.count(c) == 0) {
                stack.push(c);
            } else {
                if (stack.empty() || stack.top() != map[c]) {
                    return false;
                }
                stack.pop();
            }
        }
        return stack.empty();
    }
};
```

### Explanation:

- **Hash Map for Bracket Pairs**: We use a hash map to store the corresponding opening bracket for each type of closing bracket (`)`, `}`, `]`). This allows for quick lookup when we encounter a closing bracket.
- **Stack Usage**: A stack is used to keep track of the unmatched opening brackets. When a closing bracket matches the top of the stack, we pop it off the stack, effectively marking it as matched. If a mismatch is found, or if the stack is non-empty at the end, the string is invalid.

---

### Complexity Analysis:

- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where `n` is the length of the string `s`.
  - We perform a single pass through the string, with each push and pop operation on the stack taking O(1) time.

- **Space Complexity**: O(n)
  - In the worst case, all characters could be opening brackets, requiring O(n) space for the stack.
