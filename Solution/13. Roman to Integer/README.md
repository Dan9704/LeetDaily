# LeetDaily Challenge: Roman to Integer

**LeetCode Problem #13**  
**Difficulty**: Easy

**Link to the Problem**: [LeetCode - Roman to Integer](https://leetcode.com/problems/roman-to-integer/)

### Scenario:
The **Roman to Integer Problem** requires us to convert a Roman numeral string to an integer. Roman numerals are represented by the symbols I, V, X, L, C, D, and M, each with a specific integer value. Some numerals are subtracted rather than added when a smaller numeral appears before a larger one.

---

### Approach:

1. **Mapping Roman Symbols to Values**:  
   - We store each Roman symbolâ€™s integer value in a hash map for easy lookup.

2. **Iteration with Conditional Addition/Subtraction**:
   - For each character in the string, check if its value is less than the value of the next character:
     - If yes, subtract it (indicating it should be subtracted from the total).
     - If not, add it to the total.

### Code (C++):

```cpp
#include <unordered_map>
#include <string>

class Solution {
public:
    int romanToInt(std::string s) {
        std::unordered_map<char, int> roman = {
            {'I', 1}, {'V', 5}, {'X', 10}, {'L', 50},
            {'C', 100}, {'D', 500}, {'M', 1000}
        };

        int ans = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < s.length(); i++) {
            if (roman[s[i]] < roman[s[i + 1]]) {
                ans -= roman[s[i]];
            } else {
                ans += roman[s[i]];
            }
        }
        return ans;
    }
};
```

### Explanation:

- **Mapping**: Each Roman numeral is mapped to its integer value in an unordered map for quick access.
- **Iteration**: Loop through each character in the string `s`.
  - If the current numeral is less than the next numeral, subtract it (e.g., IV is 4 because I < V).
  - Otherwise, add it to the total.
  
This approach handles both cases (addition and subtraction) in a single loop.
